[00:13.43] Do
[00:17.33] You enjoy
[00:22.48] Your sight
[00:27.16] Inside
[00:30.16] 
[00:32.02] Disconnect and let me drift
[00:33.98] Until my upside down is right side in
[00:36.22] Society must let the artist go
[00:38.67] To wander off into the nebula
[00:53.17] 
[00:42.80] Wander off into you nebula
[00:43.77] Your nectarine of multiplicity
[00:45.03] Cum like orgasmatron
[00:48.46] On overdrive
[00:50.86] Wander in off to your nebula
[00:52.11] Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine
[00:54.99] So, pick your prize
[01:04.49] 
[01:08.83] In
[01:12.83] Little black book
[01:17.77] Do I
[01:22.52] Confide
[01:26.02] 
[01:27.13] Upon return, I conjure what was seen
[01:29.14] I let it pulse and boil within my limbs
[01:31.53] I lay my pencil to the porous page
[01:33.79] And let my lunatic indulge itself
[01:50.29] 
[01:39.19] Wander off into you nebula
[01:39.79] Your nectarine of multiplicity
[01:41.16] Cum like orgasmatron
[01:42.66] On overdrive
[01:46.13] Wander in off to your nebula
[01:47.44] Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine
[01:48.94] So, pick your prize, prize, prize, prize
[02:08.94] 
[02:09.32] "Such as is found in the crab: nebula"
[02:19.87] "Such as is found: nebula"
[02:28.08] "Nebula is found, is found"
[02:41.58] 
[02:51.40] Disconnect and let me drift
[02:53.24] Until my upside down is right side in
[02:55.60] Society must let the artist go
[02:58.07] To wander off into the nebula
[03:12.57] 
[03:02.06] Wander off into you nebula
[03:03.17] Your nectarine of multiplicity
[03:04.47] Cum like orgasmatron
[03:06.13] On overdrive
[03:12.13] 
[03:10.10] Wander in off to your nebula
[03:11.43] Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine
[03:14.30] So, pick your prize
