Will I remember when it was alright?
When you could love us and we were together
Never stop walking and turning the lights
As if you could only do this forever

I keep wondering if you understand what I say
If you know who I am, if you know who we are
If you can remember all this when you look into my eyes
Images coming to life, like reflections of the past

I promised you one time
That while my heart can beat
I'll never stop writing about
The love we felt from you
Watch me, hear me, I'm still here
Are you proud of what I've become?
Touch me, hug me, feel my soul
Although I know you won't understand my song

I can't remember where is my last sight
Looking at you without feeling this dark pain
Is there a way we could go back in time?
I hate to think that we all missed the last train

Like the light of a dead star
Will you lighten us tonight?
Or only shine in the past between interstellar dust?
Oh how many years have gone by since it began?
While we're getting old, you are getting younger

Watch me, hear me, I'm still here
Are you proud of what I've become?
Touch me, hug me, feel my soul
Although I know you won't understand my song
